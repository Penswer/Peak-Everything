# Peak-Everything
Simple mod menu that does a bit of this and a bit of that.

## Notes
If you downloaded this mod early on you may want to remove the ImGui folder from your plugins and replace it with the [DearImGuiInjection](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/penswer/DearImGuiInjection/) package. They are the same but if you have both installed conflicts may arise.

If the mod is not launching and you are sure you followed all other directions you may want to try adding -DX12 to your PEAK launch parameters on steam

## DO NOT USE WITH GALE
Due to a certain limitation with steam there doesn't seem to be a way to make PEAK use DX12 when launching through Gale.
If someone knows how to do this message "Penswer" on discord.
If you want to use this mod you will have to do a manual BepInEx install or move your Gale BepInEx profile into the game's files and launch through steam.
Please do not bother anyone who works on Gale about this. It is not their fault.

## Comments
Don't be a dinghead. \
There is no matchmaking in this game so if you join your friend just to mess with their run you just suck.
